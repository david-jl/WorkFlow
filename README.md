# Workflow

My workflow for web using gulp

## Getting Started


### Installing

You need you install de dependencies from the json
```
npm install
```

### Firebase

You have to change in index.html, at the bottom change the script where firebase is initialize with the one firebase give to you.

## Include

* Firebase
* Bootstrap
* Browser-sync
* Autoprefixer
* Cssnano
* Htmlmin
* Imagemin
* Sass
* Uglify

## Directories

The app directory is where you have to write the code and put the images in their corresponding folder.
The public directory is the one you have to upload to your website.
Do not change de src because they are write for using them in the public directory.


## Use

In the terminal, you need to write for reducing html, css and js, compile scss in css, run browserSync...

```
gulp
```

Then, if you want to reduce images, run

```
gulp imagenes
```
